This is a helper function I used in my Tutorials and PhD Research to extract features from EEG records.

Although the code is generally well documented in the .py file, my intension is to return to it and improve the documentation in the future.

It is not intended to be used as a package in its current state and I havent tested it on the latest versions, checked dependencies ect.
